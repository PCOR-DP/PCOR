MainAlgorithms: is the code for i) the Exponential mechanism ii) uniform sampling iii) random walk iv) Breadth-first search, and v) depth-first search  

Grubbs, LOF, Hist: Are the evaluations of the algorithms in the "MainAlgorithms" over outlier detection algorithms: i) Grubbs, ii) Local outlier factor, and iii) Histogram over "Salary" dataset  

Murder: the repeat of the previous experiments for the "homicide" dataset  

dataset: contains FilteredData for the Salary dataset, plus the original and filtered data for "homicide" dataset  

OCDP: is the evaluation of the context match in output constrained differential privacy, evaluated on both datasets and for all outlier detection algorithms
